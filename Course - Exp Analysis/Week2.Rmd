###The Lattice Plotting System

The lattice plotting system is implemented using the following packages:

* lattice: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the "base" graphics system; includes functions like 'xyploy', 'bwplot', 'levelplot'
* grid: implements a different graphing system independent of the "base" system; the lattice package builds on top of grid

```{r}
library(lattice)
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
f <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y <- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f <- factor(f, labels = c("Group 1", "Group 2"))
xyplot(y~x|f, layout = c(2,1))
```

```{r}
xyplot(y~x|f, panel = function(x, y, ...) {
        panel.xyplot(x,y,...)
        panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2)
})

```
